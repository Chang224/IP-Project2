        <h2>More about Akan Names</h2>
        <p>The Akan people of Ghana (an ethnic group making up close to 50% of ghanas population) frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born 
            and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul 
            and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth 
            order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.

            This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. 
            During the 18thâ€“19th centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day 
            Ghana were referred to as Coromantees. Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had
            "day names" including Cuffy, Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or 
            Kwame/Kwamina.</p>
